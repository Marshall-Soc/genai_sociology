This repository contains all `R` code necessary to reproduce the analysis in "Generative AI in Sociological Research: State of the Discipline." 

Once you download this repo, make your working directory the `scripts/` subfolder. You will then want to start with the `0_start_here.R` file.

The data are not available in this repo. The data are available, with the necessary approvals, from Zenodo. You can access the data [here](https://zenodo.org/records/17434907). Once you have the file, create a `data/` subfolder and move the data there. Note that you may need to either change the file name or the name referenced in the `R` scripts to match. The ICPSR file comes with a codebook.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used in sociological research. We present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. Our survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? We find that respondents primarily use GenAI for writing assistance, but comparatively little in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.
